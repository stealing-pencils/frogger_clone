Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

## Directions

1. Open the index.html in your preferred browser.

2. You will be met by your Sprite who you need to safely direct across the street so you can reach the opposite river.

3. While directing your Sprite
across the street, you will
be met by speeding ladybugs.
Your object is to reach the river as many times as possible whilst avoiding the ladybugs who will try to hit you at higher and higher speeds!

4. Your score will be tallied at the top of the screen as will the level you're on.


GOOD LUCK!
